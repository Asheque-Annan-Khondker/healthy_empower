/* !!!!!! NEEDS MORE STYLING  !!!!!!
      just barebone structure, we can fill in details later, we have more pressing matters 
      sorry guys im slow :((
      
      'Start-Up Guides' idea is subject to change, but for now leave as is.
      Decided on 'start-up' rather than fitness guides to make it easier to write general content 
      rather than specific workout plans/ guides which we'd have to think about A LOT.
      BUT it may change idk. for now this is easy, we can get back to it later.
