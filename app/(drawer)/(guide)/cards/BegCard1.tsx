        To build consistency in fitness, don{"\’"}t go nuts—start small and stash manageable goals like acorns. Stick to a routine you can scurry back to daily. 
        Choose workouts you{"\’"}ll go nuts for, so it{"\’"}s not a chore. Track your progress so you don't lose your trail. Even if you slip, don{"\’"}t squirrel 
        away guilt—just get back to it. With steady effort, you{"\’"}ll be fit enough to leap branch to branch in no time!
