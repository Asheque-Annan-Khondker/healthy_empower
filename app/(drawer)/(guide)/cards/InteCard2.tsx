        Building endurance is a marathon, not a mad squirrel dash! Start with steady-paced activities and gradually add more timeâ€”just like collecting acorns bit by bit. 
        Stay hydrated, fuel wisely, and don{"\'"}t burn out your bushy tail too soon. Keep at it, and you{"\'"}ll soon be bounding through long workouts like a squirrel on a power line!
